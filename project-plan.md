It's an excellent goal to dive into game development with Godot, especially for someone new to both programming and game engines! Godot is a fantastic choice because it's beginner-friendly, open-source, and free.

This tutorial offers a great introduction to many core concepts by building a basic 2D platformer with a player, enemies, moving platforms, and collectible coins. It also uses **GDScript**, Godot's own scripting language, which is "pretty fast and easy to use but still quite powerful". While some programming will be introduced, the tutorial explicitly states that full understanding of all code isn't expected immediately, as the main focus is getting familiar with Godot and getting a game up and running.

Here's a suggested plan, broken down into manageable daily chunks, keeping in mind a beginner's pace. Feel free to adjust the time spent on each day based on how quickly concepts click.

### **Beginner's Godot Game Development Plan (10 Days)**

**Overall Goal:** To successfully create your first basic 2D platformer game using Godot, following the "How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial."

**Important Notes for the Learner:**
*   **Pace Yourself:** This plan is a suggestion. Some days might take longer, others shorter. The most important thing is to understand what you're doing, not just copy-pasting.
*   **Don't Fear the Code (Yet!):** You'll encounter GDScript. For now, focus on understanding *what* the code does in general, rather than every line. The tutorial's creator notes that a dedicated GDScript programming video will follow.
*   **Hands-on is Key:** Follow along by building the game yourself.
*   **Experiment:** Once you've completed a section, try changing small things to see what happens. This is how you truly learn!
*   **Resources:** If you get stuck, remember "documentation, tutorials or code examples you find online" are valuable. The tutorial itself is a great resource.

**Day 1: Introduction to Godot & Project Setup**
*   **Focus:** Understanding what Godot is, installing it, and setting up your first project.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Watch/Read:** Introduction to Godot, why it's a good choice.
    2.  **Action:** Install Godot by going to `gdoengine.org` and downloading the latest version. Unzip and place the folder where you remember it.
    3.  **Action:** Open Godot, cancel example projects, create a new project (e.g., "first game"), and create its folder.
    4.  **Watch/Read:** Understand what "assets" are (sprites, models, textures, sounds) and that Godot is for "putting everything together".
    5.  **Action:** Download the free assets provided in the tutorial's link.
    6.  **Action:** In Godot, create `assets`, `scripts`, and `scenes` folders, then drag and drop the downloaded assets into the `assets` folder.
    7.  **Watch/Read:** Learn about **Nodes** (fundamental building blocks) and **Scenes** (reusable packages of nodes). Understand the concept of a "scene tree" and the "root" node.
*   **Review/Reflection:** What are nodes and scenes, and why are they important?

**Day 2: Your First Player Character & Ground**
*   **Focus:** Creating your player character's basic visuals and collision, and giving them something to stand on.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** Create a new 2D scene for your game, rename its root node to "Game", and save it in your `scenes` folder.
    2.  **Action:** Create a new scene for your player. Use `CharacterBody2D` as the root node (specialized for script-moved characters that collide).
    3.  **Action:** Add an `AnimatedSprite2D` node to your player to add graphics. Configure its "idle" animation using the provided sprite sheet.
    4.  **Action:** Fix blurry pixel art by changing **Project Settings > Rendering > Textures > Default Texture Filter** to `Nearest`. Adjust animation FPS and enable autoplay.
    5.  **Action:** Add a `CollisionShape2D` node to your player and give it a `CircleShape2D`. Position it slightly smaller than the graphics for good gameplay. Rename the root node to "Player" and save the scene.
    6.  **Action:** Go back to your "Game" scene, drag your "Player" scene into it.
    7.  **Action:** Add a `Camera2D` node, adjust its zoom (e.g., 4x4), and position it over the player.
    8.  **Action:** Play your game (F5) to see the idle animation.
    9.  **Action:** Add a script to your "Player" node using the **"Basic Movement" template**. Save it in the `scripts` folder.
    10. **Action:** Go back to your "Game" scene. Add a `StaticBody2D` (for immovable objects) and a `CollisionShape2D` with a `WorldBoundaryShape` to serve as basic ground. Position it below your player.
    11. **Action:** Play the game to see your player land and move with arrow keys/spacebar.
    12. **Action:** Adjust the `SPEED` and `JUMP_VELOCITY` constants in your player script to fine-tune movement.
*   **Review/Reflection:** What's the difference between `CharacterBody2D` and `StaticBody2D`? Why do physics bodies need collision shapes?

**Day 3: Building Your World with Tilemaps & Camera**
*   **Focus:** Creating detailed levels efficiently using tilemaps and making your camera follow the player smoothly.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, remove the temporary `StaticBody2D` ground.
    2.  **Action:** Add a `TileMap` node.
    3.  **Watch/Read:** Understand **tilemaps** (drawing tiles on a grid) and **tilesets** (collection of tiles for painting).
    4.  **Action:** Create a new `TileSet` resource in the inspector, ensure tile size is 16x16.
    5.  **Action:** In the TileSet editor, drag in `world_tile_set.png`, automatically create tiles, and use the eraser/shift-click to refine tile definitions (e.g., palm trees).
    6.  **Action:** Go to the TileMap editor, select a tile, and start painting your level. Use multiple tile selection and the select tool for efficiency.
    7.  **Action:** Play your game. Notice the player falls through.
    8.  **Action:** In your `TileMap` node, go to `Tile Set > Physics Layers`, and add a new layer.
    9.  **Action:** In the TileSet editor, select the solid tiles and paint the physics layer onto them. For partial colliders (like the bridge), refine the collision shape directly within the TileSet editor.
    10. **Action:** Play the game to confirm player collision with the ground.
    11. **Action:** In your "Game" scene, drag the `Camera2D` node under the `Player` node to make it a child. Enable `Position Smoothing` on the camera.
    12. **Action:** Play the game to see the camera smoothly follow your player.
*   **Review/Reflection:** How do tilemaps simplify level design? What is the purpose of physics layers on tiles?

**Day 4: Moving Platforms & Draw Order**
*   **Focus:** Adding dynamic platforms and ensuring things are drawn in the correct order.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** Create a new scene for a platform. Use `AnimatableBody2D` as the root node (for animated nodes that collide).
    2.  **Action:** Add a `Sprite2D` node, drag in `platforms.png`, and use "Region Enabled" and "Edit Region" to crop out a single grass platform.
    3.  **Action:** Add a `CollisionShape2D` with a `RectangleShape2D` and fit it to your platform graphics. Rename the root node to "Platform" and save the scene.
    4.  **Action:** Drag a platform into your "Game" scene.
    5.  **Action:** In the "Platform" scene, select the `CollisionShape2D` and enable `One-way Collision`.
    6.  **Action:** In your "Player" scene, select the root `Player` node, go to `Ordering`, and set its `Z-Index` to `5` to ensure it draws on top of platforms.
    7.  **Action:** Play the game to test one-way platforms and player draw order.
    8.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, add another platform where you want it to move. Add an `AnimationPlayer` node *as a child of this specific platform instance*.
    9.  **Action:** Create a new animation named "move" in the `AnimationPlayer`. Use keyframes to record the platform's `transform > position` at the start and end of its movement.
    10. **Action:** Enable "loop" (ping-pong style) and "autoplay" for the animation. Adjust animation length if needed.
    11. **Action:** Play the game to see your moving platform.
*   **Review/Reflection:** When would you use `AnimatableBody2D`? How does `Z-Index` affect what you see?

**Day 5: Collectibles & Your First Programming**
*   **Focus:** Creating a collectible coin and writing your very first simple script to make it disappear when the player touches it.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** Create a new scene for a coin. Use `Area2D` as the root node (for detecting collisions without physical interaction).
    2.  **Action:** Add an `AnimatedSprite2D`, configure its animation using `coin.png`, and enable autoplay.
    3.  **Action:** Add a `CollisionShape2D` with a `CircleShape2D` for the coin's detection area. Rename the root node to "Coin" and save the scene.
    4.  **Action:** Drag several "Coin" scenes into your "Game" level.
    5.  **Action:** In your "Coin" scene, add a new script using the **"Default Template"**. Save it in the `scripts` folder.
    6.  **Watch/Read:** Learn about the `_ready()` function (called at game start) and `_process()` (runs every frame).
    7.  **Action:** Experiment with `print("I'm a coin")` inside `_ready()` to see output in the console.
    8.  **Watch/Read:** Understand **Signals** (triggering code based on events).
    9.  **Action:** Select the "Coin" `Area2D` node, go to the `Node` tab, find the `body_entered` signal, double-click it, and connect it to your coin script.
    10. **Action:** In the newly created `_on_body_entered()` function, add `print("+1 coin")`. Test it to see if the message appears when any body enters.
    11. **Action:** To make the coin only detect the player, go to your "Player" scene, select the `Player` node, and change its `Collision > Physics Layer` from 1 to 2.
    12. **Action:** Go to your "Coin" scene, select the `Coin` node, and set its `Collision > Mask` to `Layer 2`. This ensures it only detects things on layer 2 (your player).
    13. **Action:** In your coin script's `_on_body_entered()` function, add `queue_free()` after the print statement to remove the coin scene when picked up.
    14. **Action:** Test your coins!.
*   **Review/Reflection:** What's the difference between `CharacterBody2D`, `AnimatableBody2D`, and `Area2D`? What are signals and how did you use one?

**Day 6: Dying, Killzones & Scene Organization**
*   **Focus:** Implementing a death mechanic, restarting the game, and organizing your scene.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, select the `Camera2D` under your player. Go to `Limit` and set a `Bottom` limit (e.g., 120 pixels) to prevent the camera from following the player infinitely down. Enable smoothing for the limit.
    2.  **Action:** Create a new scene for a "Kill Zone". Use `Area2D` as the root node. Set its `Collision > Mask` to `Layer 2` (for the player). Rename and save it as "KillZone".
    3.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, add the "KillZone" scene (you can use the link icon next to the plus sign for new nodes). Add a `CollisionShape2D` to this instance of the Kill Zone, using a `WorldBoundaryShape` to create an infinite bottom boundary. Position it far below your level.
    4.  **Action:** In your "KillZone" scene, add an **empty script**. Connect the `body_entered` signal to it.
    5.  **Action:** In the `_on_body_entered()` function, add `print("You died")`.
    6.  **Action:** Add a `Timer` node as a child of your "KillZone" node. Set its `Wait Time` (e.g., 0.6 seconds) and enable `One Shot`.
    7.  **Action:** Drag the `Timer` node into your Kill Zone script while holding `Ctrl` to create a variable reference to it.
    8.  **Action:** In `_on_body_entered()`, add `timer.start()`.
    9.  **Action:** Connect the `timeout` signal from your `Timer` node to your Kill Zone script.
    10. **Action:** In `_on_timer_timeout()`, add `get_tree().reload_current_scene()` to restart the game.
    11. **Action:** Test your kill zone by falling off the map.
    12. **Action:** In your "Game" scene, create new generic `Node`s (e.g., "Coins", "Platforms") and drag relevant elements under them to organize your scene tree.
    13. **Action:** In your `TileMap` node, add a new layer (e.g., "Background") and move it to the top so it's drawn first. Paint in some background tiles using the rectangle tool.
*   **Review/Reflection:** How does a reusable "Kill Zone" scene simplify adding danger elements? What role does the `Timer` node and its `timeout` signal play in restarting the game?

**Day 7: Simple Enemies & Scripted Movement**
*   **Focus:** Creating an enemy and giving it simple, scripted patrol behavior.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** Create a new scene for an enemy. Use `Node2D` as the base.
    2.  **Action:** Add an `AnimatedSprite2D` node. Configure its "idle" animation using the green slime sprite sheet.
    3.  **Action:** Add your reusable "KillZone" scene as a child of the enemy. Add a `CollisionShape2D` to this Kill Zone instance and fit it to your enemy sprite.
    4.  **Action:** Rename the root node to "Slime" and save the scene.
    5.  **Action:** Drag a "Slime" scene into your "Game" level. Test that touching it restarts the game.
    6.  **Action:** In your "Slime" scene, add a new script using the **"Default Template"**. Save it.
    7.  **Watch/Read:** Understand the `_process()` function, the "game loop", and `delta` (time since last frame) for frame-rate independent movement.
    8.  **Action:** In `_process()`, remove `pass`. Add code to make the slime move horizontally using `position.x += speed * delta`. Create a `const SPEED = 60` at the top.
    9.  **Action:** Test the movement in the game. It should move off-screen.
    10. **Action:** Add a `var direction = 1` at the top of the script. Modify the movement line to `position.x += direction * SPEED * delta`.
    11. **Action:** Add two `RayCast2D` nodes as children of your "Slime" node: "RayCastRight" and "RayCastLeft". Position them to shoot out from the center of the slime to detect walls.
    12. **Action:** Drag both `RayCast2D` nodes into your Slime script while holding `Ctrl` to create variable references.
    13. **Action:** In `_process()`, *before* the movement code, add `if raycast_right.is_colliding(): direction = -1` and `if raycast_left.is_colliding(): direction = 1`.
    14. **Action:** Drag the `AnimatedSprite2D` node into your Slime script while holding `Ctrl`.
    15. **Action:** Modify the `if` statements to also flip the sprite: `animated_sprite.flip_h = true` when moving left, `animated_sprite.flip_h = false` when moving right.
    16. **Action:** Test your patrolling slime.
*   **Review/Reflection:** How does `_process()` differ from `_ready()`? Why is `delta` important for movement? How do `RayCast2D` nodes help the enemy detect walls?

**Day 8: Enhanced Death & Player Script Deep Dive**
*   **Focus:** Making death more dramatic and refining the player's movement script with custom input and animations.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** In your "KillZone" script, in `_on_body_entered()`, add `Engine.time_scale = 0.5` after printing "You died" for a slow-motion effect.
    2.  **Action:** In `_on_timer_timeout()`, add `Engine.time_scale = 1.0` to reset the time scale when the game restarts.
    3.  **Action:** In `_on_body_entered()`, add `body.get_node("CollisionShape2D").queue_free()` to remove the player's collider on death, making them fall through the world.
    4.  **Watch/Read:** Understand `_physics_process()` (fixed-rate updates for physics) and how it differs from `_process()`.
    5.  **Action:** Go to **Project > Project Settings > Input Map**. Add new actions: `jump`, `move_left`, `move_right`. Bind keys to these (e.g., Space for jump, Left Arrow/A for move_left, Right Arrow/D for move_right).
    6.  **Action:** In your "Player" script, replace the default `is_action_pressed("ui_accept")` etc., with your new actions: `is_action_pressed("jump")`, `is_action_pressed("move_left")`, `is_action_pressed("move_right")`.
    7.  **Action:** Test player movement with your new keybindings.
    8.  **Action:** Drag your `AnimatedSprite2D` node into your Player script (holding `Ctrl`).
    9.  **Action:** In `_physics_process()`, after getting input direction, add `if direction > 0: animated_sprite.flip_h = false` and `else if direction < 0: animated_sprite.flip_h = true` to flip the player sprite based on movement.
    10. **Action:** In your "Player" scene, select the `AnimatedSprite2D`. Add new animations: "run" (using multiple frames from the sprite sheet) and "jump" (using a single frame from the roll animation).
    11. **Action:** In `_physics_process()`, after flipping the sprite, add logic: `if direction == 0: animated_sprite.play("idle") else: animated_sprite.play("run")`.
    12. **Action:** Modify this logic to check `if is_on_floor():` for idle/run, and `else: animated_sprite.play("jump")` if not on the floor.
    13. **Action:** Test your fully animated player.
*   **Review/Reflection:** What's the benefit of the Input Map system? Why use `_physics_process()` for player movement instead of `_process()`?

**Day 9: Text, Score & Game Manager**
*   **Focus:** Adding text elements, creating a score system, and using a "game manager" for global game data.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, add a `Label` node. Type some text (e.g., "A gameplay hint"). Scale it up.
    2.  **Action:** In the `Label`'s inspector, under `Theme Overrides > Fonts`, drag in the `pixel_operator` font asset. Set `Font Sizes` to 8 (or multiples of 8) and change the font color.
    3.  **Action:** Duplicate and place text labels around your level to provide hints or story. Organize them under a new `Node` called "Labels".
    4.  **Action:** Create a new `Node` in your "Game" scene (not `Node2D`) named "GameManager". Place it at the top of the scene tree.
    5.  **Action:** Add an **empty script** to "GameManager". Save it.
    6.  **Action:** In the `game_manager.gd` script, add `var score = 0`.
    7.  **Action:** Create a new function: `func add_point(): score += 1; print("Current Score: " + str(score))`.
    8.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, right-click the "GameManager" node and select `Access as Unique Name` (a `%` icon appears).
    9.  **Action:** In your "Coin" script, remove the old `print` line. Drag your "GameManager" node into the script (holding `Ctrl`) to get a `%GameManager` reference.
    10. **Action:** Call the `add_point` function: `%GameManager.add_point()`.
    11. **Action:** Test to ensure the score prints to the output when coins are collected.
    12. **Action:** Create a new `Label` in your "Game" scene. Rename it "ScoreLabel". Set its `Auto Wrap Mode` to `Word` and `Horizontal Alignment` to `Center`. Choose a bolder font if desired.
    13. **Action:** Drag "ScoreLabel" under "GameManager".
    14. **Action:** In `game_manager.gd`, drag "ScoreLabel" into the script (holding `Ctrl`).
    15. **Action:** In `add_point()`, replace the `print` statement with `score_label.text = "You collected " + str(score) + " coins."`. Remember `str()` to convert the number to text.
    16. **Action:** Test your in-game score display.
*   **Review/Reflection:** Why use a generic `Node` for the Game Manager? What does "Access as Unique Name" do, and why is it useful here?

**Day 10: Audio & Exporting Your Game**
*   **Focus:** Adding music and sound effects, and preparing your game for sharing.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, add an `AudioStreamPlayer2D` node. Rename it "Music".
    2.  **Action:** Drag the `Time for Adventure` music track asset into the "Stream" slot. Enable `Autoplay`.
    3.  **Action:** Double-click the music stream asset, enable `Loop` in the importer, and click `Reimport`.
    4.  **Action:** Open the `Audio` tab at the bottom. Add two new buses: "Music" and "Sound Effects". Route your "Music" node's bus to "Music" and adjust the volume (e.g., -12 dB).
    5.  **Action:** In your "Game" scene, drag the "Music" node into your `scenes` folder to save it as a separate scene.
    6.  **Action:** Delete the "Music" node from your "Game" scene.
    7.  **Action:** Go to **Project > Project Settings > Autoload**. Click the folder icon, select your `music.tscn` scene, and click `Add`.
    8.  **Action:** Test: play the game, then restart. The music should persist.
    9.  **Action:** In your "Coin" scene, add an `AudioStreamPlayer` node. Rename it "PickupSound". Drag the `coin_sound` asset into its "Stream" slot. Set its bus to "Sound Effects".
    10. **Action:** Add an `AnimationPlayer` node to your "Coin" scene.
    11. **Action:** Create a new animation named "pickup". Use keyframes to:
        *   Hide the `AnimatedSprite2D`'s `visible` property.
        *   Disable the `CollisionShape2D`'s `disabled` property.
        *   Play the `PickupSound`'s `playing` property.
        *   After 1 second, add a `Call Method Track` on the "Coin" node to call `queue_free()`.
    12. **Action:** In your "Coin" script, drag the `AnimationPlayer` node into the script (holding `Ctrl`).
    13. **Action:** Replace `queue_free()` with `animation_player.play("pickup")`.
    14. **Action:** Test your coins with sound and visual feedback.
    15. **Action:** Go to **Editor > Manage Export Templates** and click `Download and Install`.
    16. **Action:** Go to **Project > Export**. Add a `Windows Desktop` platform. Enable `Embed PCK`. Set the `Product Name` (e.g., "Princess Dragon Slayer").
    17. **Action:** Click `Export Project`, choose a location, uncheck `Export With Debug`, and `Save`.
    18. **Action:** Find your `.exe` file on your desktop and run your game!.
    19. **Watch/Read:** Review the "Where do you go from here?" section for ideas on expanding your game.
